-- Javascript: Node autocompletion

To use Javascript autocompletion, emacs is configured to
use js2-mode and company-tern. However, tern needs to be
installed manually from 'npm' repos:

  npm install -g tern

Then create a symbolic link of the tern binary to PATH.

Besides, company-tern needs some sort of config file.
This file can be created in each project folder or it
may be read from the home folder, so create a file
named ~/.tern-project with the following contents:

{
    "libs": [
        "browser",
        "underscore",
        "jquery"
            ],
        "plugins": {
          "node": {}
        }
}

Note that additiona libs may be specified to auto-
complete certain projects. Just add them there.

-- Javascript: Express autocompletion

Tern does not support express autocompletion by default
so, we need to install a plugin for tern.

Clone https://github.com/angelozerr/tern-node-express
and then copy the file 'node-express.js' to $TERN_BASE/plugins
update ~/.tern-project with:

{
    "libs": [
        "browser",
        "underscore",
        "jquery"
            ],
        "plugins": {
          "node": {},
	  "node-express": {}
        }
}
